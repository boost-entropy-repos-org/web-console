# Web Console
Provides a simple web interface for command-line applications - quickly publish your Python / Go / Bash / Powershell / etc script as a basic web app. Turns STDOUT into formatted text, alerts and progress indicators (interface written using Bootstrap / JQuery). Supports any target language, simply runs any command-line based script or executable.

Cross-platform (written in Go), runs as a self-contained executable complete with embedded web server on Windows, Linux and MacOS. The install process includes optional setup as a service / deamon on each platform (uses [NSSM](https://nssm.cc/) on Windows), plus the installer includes setup for [tunnelto.dev](https://tunnelto.dev/) to provide a secure connection through a firewall and a handy subdomain to point a browser at if needed.

Python (Flask) version also available to run on (for instance) [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/).

Simple API, handles authentication (without using cookies), provides a mechanism for third-parties to handle authorisation. Can be used to provide webhook URIs for your scripts for services such as [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) and [Zapier](https://zapier.com/).

## Live Demo

Link to live demo goes here.

The above link runs the following simple Python 3 application:

```
import sys
import time

wordArray = ["The","Quick","Brown","Fox","Jumped","Over","The","Lazy","Dog"]

for pl in range(0, len(wordArray)):
    print (wordArray[pl])
    print ("Progress: Progress " + str(int(round(pl / (len(wordArray)-1), 2) * 100)))
    sys.stdout.flush()
    time.sleep(2)
```

The demo application simply prints a sentance a word at a time, one word every two seconds. It also prints a progress percentage, which is displayed by Web Console as a progress bar.

## Task Configuration Files

Webconsole will look in the defined "tasks" folder (by default, on Linux, /etc/webconsole) for subfolders. Any subfolders found will be searched for a "config.txt" file and used as a Task ID if found. Task IDs generated by the Webconsole application are random 16-character strings, but any string (no spaces) can be used.

The format of config.txt is as keywords followed by a colon then the given value, i.e.

```
title: Test Site
public: N
command: /root/buildSite.sh
```
Valid keywords are:
title: The title of the Task, displayed in the header on the Task page and as the page title.
description: Descriptive text saying what the task does.
secret: A secret phrase / key / password. If present, must be given during the authentication process - can be passed in via GET (not very secure) or POST.
public: If "Y", this Task will be listed on the index page. Obviously, only use for Tasks you want to be made public.
ratelimit: If more than 0, then this Task will not be allowed to run more often than the given number of seconds.
progress: If "Y", then a progress bar will be presented on the page. The percentages the progress bar shows will be guessed from previous runtimes of this Task.
command: The command line to run. Pretty much any valid command line (or shell / batch script) should work.

Note that changes to config.txt for any Task will be in effect the next time the Task is triggered, without any need to restart / reload anything server side or even refresh the web interface if you already have the Task's page open.
